## GitHub Signup Process {#github-signup-process .emphasized}

	- Make sure your GitHub username is your NMDP username and *-nmdp* added to it. Eg. my GitHub username is **pbashyal-nmdp** 
	- Use your nmdp.org email address for the email
2. Email me your GitHub username after you're signed up.
3. I'll add you to CIBMTR org team and you will be sent an invite email to join.

## Git vs GitHub

- **Git** is the revision control software.

  Git compares to **SVN**, **CVS** 

<div class="notes">
  Git is mostly unlearning centrality aspect of SVN, CVS.
</div>

- **GitHub** is a website and the remote server that hosts all the git repositories.

  GitHub compares to **BitBucket**, **GitLab** 

## A tour of GitHub

- Profile page
  - Profile Update Bio etc.
  - Security - Change Password
  
- Create a `hello-world` repo
  
- Settings on each repo

- Issues

- Pull Requests

- Wikis (like Confluence)

- Reference: [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

<div class="notes">
  This is the model to use if you're working on your own codebase, not sharing with others or working in BitBucket.
</div>

## A tour of Git

Know **git** is terrible. It's not you.

Keep it simple and you'll be fine.

## Git concepts

- Repository
- Fork
- Branch
- Upstream
- Origin
- Git add to stage
- Git Commit
- Pull Requests

## Git Configure 

- git config

  Set your global config
  ```
  git config --global user.name "Pradeep Bashyal"
  git config --global user.email "email@nmdp.org"
  ```

## Git Forking Workflow {#forking-workflow}

Fork -> Clone -> Feature Branch -> **Code Changes** -> Merge Upstream -> Push -> PR 

[Forking Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow) :

- A developer 'forks' an 'official' server-side repository. This creates their own server-side copy.
- The new server-side copy is cloned to their local system.
- A Git remote path for the 'official' repository is added to the local clone.
- A new local feature branch is created.
- The developer makes changes on the new branch.
- New commits are created for the changes.
- The branch gets pushed to the developer's own server-side copy.
- The developer opens a pull request from the new branch to the 'official' repository.
- The pull request gets approved for merge and is merged into the original server-side repository

## Git Bash Tool

- Bash Git Prompt

  ```
    brew install bash-git-prompt
  ```

## Git commands 

- git clone

- git status

- git branch

## Git commands
